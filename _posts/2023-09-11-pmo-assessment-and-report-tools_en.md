Have you ever been involved on a project with no deadlines, unlimited resources, and unlimited scope? Probably not. 
Projects need to be delivered on time, with a budget (and benefits (smile) ), and delivering the correct functionality... 
The time cost quality relationship is shown as a Time Cost Quality triangle:

You may have worked under the guidelines of a quality triangle, also known as a project management triangle, iron triangle, 
or project triangle.

Why is that? Why limits our ability to create a product or improve a system?

- First, the world we work and live in has limits. We have a lot of time to do, only a set of resources available and 
limited knowledge. We do our best with what we have to work with at the time.

- Second, as sometimes is said, "If there's no deadline, you'll happily play with the plan and test."

### PMO Assessment and Reports for Jira
With this component a user can easily create accounts based on a set of Jira projects within a time period and obtain 
summarized information about these project triangle axis. Our goal is to offer tools to control them:

- **Time**: how many time have been logged? What about estimations?

- **Cost**: We know that on Atlassian Jira, sometimes is difficult to get cost info based on your organization human costs and project budget.

- **Quality**: Also, project quality must be measured in order to improve how projects are delivered. As an example:
  - Jira issues lost in space??
  - Little issue details on summary or description?
  - Resolved after due date?
  - And much more...
