## New feature: Notifications issue tab

The app now incorporates a 'Notifications' issue tab. 
Available with specific design for Jira Software & Core and Jira Service Desk. **Easily check all the email notifications that have been sent, to who, and with which content/subject.** 
Keep track of emails sent, easily optimise Jira notifications and browse through notifications history to identify deviations.

## Subscription model: free features and paid version

If you have been an user of excentia Admin Tools for some time, you may have noticed it. 
With the introduction of 'Notifications' feature we changed our price policy for the app. 

**excentia Admin Tools is now based on a freemium model** What does this mean? **The app is free to use and install, but you'll need to acquire a paid license to enjoy some of the premium features.**

As for right now, all features (workflow extensions, maintenance mode, transition history issue tab, report... ) are free except for Notifications issue tab. 

How are we making it work on the [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1219118/excentia-admin-tools-for-jira?hosting=datacenter&tab=overview)? If you want to enjoy only the free features of excentia Admin Tools, you can do it as it follows:

* 'Try it free' button: install an evalution license of the free and premium features. Once the evalution period is over, you'll keep enjoying free features. On the premium features, a banner will ask you to upgrade. If you don't want to, that's cool.

* [Versions history page](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1219118/excentia-admin-tools-for-jira/version-history): Download last version and avoid going through the process of licensing. This way you'll only install free features. 

If you have any questions about our freemium model, you are more than welcome to [ask us](https://excentia.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/14). 



## Data Center approved

excentia Admin Tools is available for [Data Center](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1219118/excentia-admin-tools-for-jira?hosting=datacenter&tab=overview) installations. 

Makes sense as it's administrator features are specially useful for those who manage large enterprise installations.
