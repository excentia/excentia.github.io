<h2 id="S4"><b>How we store and protect your personal data</b></h2><br>

We use hosting service providers to host the information we collect, and we employ technical measures to secure your data. The EXCENTIA website is hosted on GitHub.<br><br>

While safeguards have been put in place to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable. Due to the very nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee that data is completely safe from intrusion, either while it is hosted on our systems, or while it is being transmitted. <br><br>

<b>Preservation of information</b><br>

The periods of preservation of the personal information we collect depend on the type of information as described below. We will delete or anonymize your information after the relevant deadline. If this is not possible, for example because the information has been stored in backup files, we will securely host your information and isolate it from any possible use until it is possible to proceed with deletion. <br><br>

<b>Account Information</b>: We preserve your account information for as long as your account is active and for a reasonable period thereafter, should you decide to reactivate the Services.  We also retain certain data necessary to comply with our legal obligations and agreements, settle disputes, sustain our business operations and continue to develop and improve our services. When your information is preserved for the purpose of improving and developing the Service, we take the necessary steps to delete data that directly identifies you and we only use data aimed at drawing conclusions related to general patterns of use of our Services, and not to analyze any personal characteristics. <br><br>

<b>Information shared in services</b>: In case of deactivation or disabling of your account, some of the data and content you have posted will remain visible so that your teammates have the possibility to make full use of our Services. For example, weâ€™ll continue to display the project fields youâ€™ve created. <br><br>

<b>Marketing Information</b>: If you have decided to receive marketing emails, we will preserve data about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period from the last date you expressed interest in our Services, like the last time you opened an EXCENTIA email or the last time you used your account. We preserve information related to cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time after the date of creation of such information. <br><br>

<h2 id="S5"><b>How to access and control your personal data</b></h2><br>

You can make numerous decisions regarding your personal data. Below is a list of your rights, how to exercise them, as well as applicable limitations. <br><br>

<b>Your rights:</b><br>

You have the right to request a copy of your personal data, to oppose the use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured electronic format. Below, we describe the tools and processes to which you must go to make these requests. You may exercise some of your rights by accessing our Services and using the settings available in your account. Wherever services are being managed by an administrator, you may need to contact them to respond to your requests. For any other request, you can write to us at the contact details in the About Us section at the end of this document. <br><br>

<b>Access and update your information:</b> As a user of one of the EXCENTIA apps, your profile information belongs to your Atlassian account, so you must go directly to the corresponding Atlassian channels to update your information. <br><br>

As a potential customer or current customer on any of the other Services, you may send a request to the contact details indicated at the end of this document, requesting a copy of your information or indicating the data that must be updated. <br><br>

<b>Deactivate your account:</b>If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator must deactivate the account of our Services. If you can deactivate your own account, that option will be available in your account settings. Otherwise, contact your administrator. If you are an administrator and you do not have the ability to deactivate the account through the administrator settings, please contact EXCENTIA customer support.<br><br>

<b>Request that we stop using your information:</b> You may request that we stop accessing, storing, using or otherwise processing your data if you believe that we do not have the right to perform such operations. In the event that you have granted your permission for a limited use of your personal data, you may inform us of your decision to revoke such consent, but this revocation will not affect operations that have already been performed. You may also request through the channel below that your information cease to be used for marketing purposes. Upon receipt of such requests, EXCENTIA may need time to conduct relevant investigations and respond to the request. If there are delays or disagreements about our right to continue using your data, we will block the use of your information as long as the request or disagreement has not been resolved, provided that your administrator does not object, if any. <br><br>

<b>Opt-out of communications:</b> To stop receiving our promotional communications and have your contact removed from our marketing distribution list, you can use the unsubscribe link that includes each email, or contact us at the address below. Even though you are no longer on that list, you will still receive transactional messages related to our Services.<br><br>

<b>Data portability:</b> If you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file with the basic information of your account, the information you have created and stored by us, and any records of our systems (CRM, ERP, ...) associated with your data.
