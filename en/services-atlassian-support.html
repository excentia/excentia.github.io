<p>Our support provide value to our customers, advising good practices and optimal solution with the products of the <strong>Atlassian suite</strong>.</p>
<p>We have two fundamental pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>proactive maintenance</strong> in which the instance is periodically analyzed with its own tools in order to always have clean instances following the provider's best practices. This type of maintenance will always reduce the number of incidents to a minimum, putting problems first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>reactive maintenance</strong> where any user can contact <strong>excentia</strong> through a <a href="https://jira.excentia.es/servicedesk/customer/portal/14">Service Desk Portal</a> and register incidents or service requests (technical administration doubts, request for new services, evolutionary services, etc.).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our support <strong>service</strong> is complemented with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>License management</strong> to have better prices and help users to optimize their use.</li>
<li><strong>Monthly follow-up reports</strong> sent to the client with information on the trends of the instance, relevant risks, proposed improvements, etc. This follow-up includes one virtual meeting every two months with the team in charge of the client.</li>
<li><strong>Escalation to the support</strong> of different providers, with which product incidents are solved more quickly. Considering that very few Atlassian tools work alone and are based on the app ecosystem, we will contact directly the provider and the developer.</li>
<li><strong>Custom developments:</strong> if you need a functionality that does not exist in the tool, we offer an additional service on demand for special tasks or developments, such as creating custom reports, custom fields, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Training</strong>: creation of specific training sessions on tools and / or apps.</li>
</ul>
